>Generate advanced and unique boostrap forms without typing a single line of code!


##What is it?

An *example or preview* is always more talkative than *long speech*.


Here is a form *YOU* could *generate* in just 1 minute (_I took time to add description, decoration etc... I could have been faster_) :

*Why angular formly? See yourself how powerfull it is* :
